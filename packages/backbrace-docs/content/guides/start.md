# Getting Started with Backbrace

This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Backbrace.
You'll use your knowledge of Javascript plus the useful features of Backbrace to build a web app for a doctor's surgery, complete with a booking system.
You don't need to install anything on your computer: you'll build the web app using the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/ "CodeSandbox web site") online development environment.

    You'll find many resources to complement the Backbrace docs. Checkout Mozilla's MDN docs on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. Various online course websites, such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, also cover web development basics.

* You'll need to log into CodeSandbox to fork the project. If you have a GitHub account, you can log into StackBlitz with that account. Fork the project using the Fork button at the top right, then you'll be able to save your work to your own CodeSandbox account.
* To copy a code example from this tutorial, click the icon at the top right of the code example box, and then paste the code snippet from the clipboard into CodeSandbox.
