### Components

Backbrace manages user input and the display of data by using components.

There are two types of components in Backbrace, `fieldcomponents` and `sectioncomponents`.

#### Field Components

Field components are used for displaying or inputting data into a single field on a page. By default `textfield` is used.

<div class="components" data-type="field"></div>

#### Section Components

Section components are used for loading a section of the page. By default `cardpage` is used.

<div class="components" data-type="section"></div>
