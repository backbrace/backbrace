### Components

Backbrace manages user input and the display of data by using components.
<br><br>
There are two types of components in Backbrace, `fieldcomponents` and `sectioncomponents`.
<br><br>
#### Field Components

Field components are used for displaying or inputting data into a single field on a page. By default `textfield` is used.
<br><br>
<a class='link' route='components/textfield'>Textfield</a>

<br><br>
#### Section Components

Section components are used for loading a section of the page. By default `cardpage` is used.
<br><br>
<a class='link' route='components/editorpage'>Editorpage</a>
